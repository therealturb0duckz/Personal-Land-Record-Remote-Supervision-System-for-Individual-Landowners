# 🌾 Agricultural Land Record & Remote Supervision System

This project presents a relational database design aimed at improving how landowners and farmers manage information about their agricultural assets.  
It focuses on preserving land knowledge across generations and replacing unreliable paper-based or memory-based management methods with a structured digital system.

## 📜 Project Background
Many landowners—especially heirs who live far from their hometowns—struggle to monitor and manage family-owned agricultural land.  
Knowledge about the land (soil type, crop history, maintenance records, fertilizer usage, etc.) is often stored informally in:
- Paper notebooks that get lost or damaged  
- Memory of elders who may no longer supervise  
- Verbal instructions passed down without documentation  

As a result, future generations face uncertainty about:
- How to maintain the land  
- How to decide what crops to grow  
- How to manage expenses, yields, and supervisors  
- Whether to keep or sell inherited land  

A structured digital system can help preserve family land, support better decisions, and maintain continuity across generations.

## 🔥 Pain Points Addressed

### **1. Lack of supervision for inherited land**
- Heirs living in another city/country cannot monitor their land.  
- No centralized record of who is responsible for checking the land.  
- The system allows assigning supervisors and tracking their activities.

### **2. Loss of agricultural knowledge across generations**
- Elders often hold key knowledge (soil type, crop cycles) in memory.  
- Future generations cannot continue operations because nothing is recorded.  
- The database provides a long-term, structured record of everything about the land.

### **3. Paper-based or memory-based record-keeping**
- Prone to loss, inconsistency, or missing data.  
- Difficult to update or share among family members.  
- The database replaces this with reliable, searchable digital records.

### **4. Poor decision-making due to missing data**
- Without tracking fertilizer use, crop types, expenses, or maintenance,  
  landowners cannot plan effectively.
- The system supports better decisions through organized data storage.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Build an ER/EER diagram that accurately models agricultural operations  
- Normalize data (1NF → 3NF) to remove redundancy  
- Implement a complete SQL schema  
- Provide sample queries for real use cases (crop history, land overview, supervisor logs)
